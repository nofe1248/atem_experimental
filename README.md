# Experimental Compiler for Atem Language
**WARNING: THIS COMPILER IS CURRENTLY IN PRE-ALPHA QUALITY AND NOT INTENDED FOR BUILDING ANY ARTIFACTS FOR PRODUCTION USE. UNCLEAR DIAGNOSTICS, LEXING/PARSING ERRORS, UNVERIFIED ILLEGAL IR, AND BAD CODEGEN ARE EXPECTED.**

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a prototype compiler for the Atem programming language. The compiler is based on the LLVM/MLIR infrastructure and currently use ANTLR4 for lexer/parser generation.
